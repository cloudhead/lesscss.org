As an extension to CSS, LESS is not only backwards compatible with CSS, but the extra features it adds use <em>existing</em> CSS syntax. This makes learning LESS a <em>breeze</em>, and if in doubt, lets you fall back to CSS.

Variables
---------

These are pretty self-explanatory:

    @nice-blue: #5B83AD;
    @light-blue: (@nice-blue + #111);

    #header { color: @light-blue; }

Outputs:

    #header { color: #6c94be; }

It is also possible to define variables with a variable name:

    @fnord: "I am fnord.";
    @var: 'fnord';
    content: @@var;

Which compiles to:

    content: "I am fnord.";

Note that variables in LESS are actually 'constants' in that they can only be defined once.

Mixins
------

In LESS, it is possible to include a bunch of properties from one ruleset into another ruleset. So say we have the following class:

    .bordered {
      border-top: dotted 1px black;
      border-bottom: solid 2px black;
    }

And we want to use these properties inside other rulesets. Well, we just have to drop in the name of
the class in any ruleset we want to include its properties, like so:

    #menu a {
      color: #111;
      .bordered;
    }
    .post a {
      color: red;
      .bordered;
    }

The properties of the `.bordered` class will now appear in both `#menu a` and `.post a`:

    #menu a {
      color: #111;
      border-top: dotted 1px black;
      border-bottom: solid 2px black;
    }
    .post a {
      color: red;
      border-top: dotted 1px black;
      border-bottom: solid 2px black;
    }

Any CSS *class* or *id* ruleset can be mixed-in that way.

Parametric Mixins
-----------------

LESS has a special type of ruleset which can be mixed in like classes, but accepts parameters. Here's the canonical example:

    .border-radius (@radius) {
      border-radius: @radius;
      -moz-border-radius: @radius;
      -webkit-border-radius: @radius;
    }

And here's how we can mix it into various rulesets:

    #header {
      .border-radius(4px);
    }
    .button {
      .border-radius(6px);
    }

Parametric mixins can also have default values for their parameters:

    .border-radius (@radius: 5px) {
      border-radius: @radius;
      -moz-border-radius: @radius;
      -webkit-border-radius: @radius;
    }

We can invoke it like this now:

    #header {
      .border-radius;
    }

And it will include a 5px border-radius.

You can also use parametric mixins which don't take parameters. This is useful if you want to hide the ruleset from the CSS output,
but want to include its properties in other rulesets:

    .wrap () {
      text-wrap: wrap;
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    pre { .wrap }

Which would output:

    pre {
      text-wrap: wrap;
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

### The `@arguments` variable

`@arguments` has a special meaning inside mixins, it contains all the arguments passed, when the mixin was called. This is useful
if you don't want to deal with individual parameters:

    .box-shadow (@x: 0, @y: 0, @blur: 1px, @color: #000) {
      box-shadow: @arguments;
      -moz-box-shadow: @arguments;
      -webkit-box-shadow: @arguments;
    }
    .box-shadow(2px, 5px);

Which results in:

      box-shadow: 2px 5px 1px #000;
      -moz-box-shadow: 2px 5px 1px #000;
      -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 5px 1px #000;

## Pattern-matching and Guard expressions

Sometimes, you may want to change the behaviour of a mixin,
based on the parameters you pass to it. Let's start with something
basic:

    .mixin (@s, @color) { ... }

    .class {
      .mixin(@switch, #888);
    }

Now let's say we want `.mixin` to behave differently, based on the value of `@switch`,
we could define `.mixin` as such:

    .mixin (dark, @color) {
      color: darken(@color, 10%);
    }
    .mixin (light, @color) {
      color: lighten(@color, 10%);
    }
    .mixin (@_, @color) {
      display: block;
    }

Now, if we run:

    @switch: light;

    .class {
      .mixin(@switch, #888);
    }

We will get the following CSS:

    .class {
      color: #a2a2a2;
      display: block;
    }

Where the color passed to `.mixin` was lightened. If the value of `@switch` was `dark`,
the result would be a darker color.

Here's what happened:

- The first mixin definition didn't match because it expected `dark` as the first argument.
- The second mixin definition matched, because it expected `light`.
- The third mixin definition matched because it expected any value.

Only mixin definitions which matched were used. Variables match and bind to any value.
Anything other than a variable matches only with a value equal to itself.

We can also match on arity, here's an example:

    .mixin (@a) {
      color: @a;
    }
    .mixin (@a, @b) {
      color: fade(@a, @b);
    }

Now if we call `.mixin` with a single argument, we will get the output of the first definition,
but if we call it with *two* arguments, we will get the second definition, namely `@a` faded to `@b`.

### Guards

Guards are useful when you want to match on *expressions*, as opposed to simple values or arity. If you are
familiar with functional programming, you have probably encountered them already.

In trying to stay as close as possible to the declarative nature of CSS, LESS has opted to implement
conditional execution via **guarded mixins** instead of if/else statements, in the vein of `@media`
query feature specifications.

Let's start with an example:

    .mixin (@a) when (lightness(@a) >= 50%) {
      background-color: black;
    }
    .mixin (@a) when (lightness(@a) < 50%) {
      background-color: white;
    }
    .mixin (@a) {
      color: @a;
    }

The key is the **`when`** keyword, which introduces a guard sequence (here with only one guard). Now if we run the following
code:

    .class1 { .mixin(#ddd) }
    .class2 { .mixin(#555) }


Here's what we'll get:

    .class1 {
      background-color: black;
      color: #ddd;
    }
    .class2 {
      background-color: white;
      color: #555;
    }

The full list of comparison operators usable in guards are: **`> >= = =< <`**. Additionally, the keyword `true`
is the only truthy value, making these two mixins equivalent:

    .truth (@a) when (@a) { ... }
    .truth (@a) when (@a = true) { ... }

Any value other than the keyword `true` is falsy:

    .class {
      .truth(40); // Will not match any of the above definitions.
    }

Guards can be separated with a comma '`,`'--if any of the guards evaluates to true, it's
considered as a match:

    .mixin (@a) when (@a > 10), (@a < -10) { ... }

Note that you can also compare arguments with each other, or with non-arguments:

    @media: mobile;

    .mixin (@a) when (@media = mobile) { ... }
    .mixin (@a) when (@media = desktop) { ... }

    .max (@a, @b) when (@a > @b) { width: @a }
    .max (@a, @b) when (@a < @b) { width: @b }

Lastly, if you want to match mixins based on value type, you can use the *is\** functions:

    .mixin (@a, @b: 0) when (isnumber(@b)) { ... }
    .mixin (@a, @b: black) when (iscolor(@b)) { ... }

Here are the basic type checking functions:

- `iscolor`
- `isnumber`
- `isstring`
- `iskeyword`
- `isurl`

If you want to check if a value, in addition to being a number, is in a specific unit, you may use one of:

- `ispixel`
- `ispercentage`
- `isem`

Last but not least, you may use the **`and`** keyword to provide additional conditions inside a guard:

    .mixin (@a) when (isnumber(@a)) and (@a > 0) { ... }

And the **`not`** keyword to negate conditions:

    .mixin (@b) when not (@b > 0) { ... }

Nested rules
------------

LESS gives you the ability to use *nesting* instead of, or in combination with cascading.
Lets say we have the following CSS:

    #header { color: black; }
    #header .navigation {
      font-size: 12px;
    }
    #header .logo {
      width: 300px;
    }
    #header .logo:hover {
      text-decoration: none;
    }

In LESS, we can also write it this way:

    #header {
      color: black;

      .navigation {
        font-size: 12px;
      }
      .logo {
        width: 300px;
        &:hover { text-decoration: none }
      }
    }

Or this way:

    #header        { color: black;
      .navigation  { font-size: 12px }
      .logo        { width: 300px;
        &:hover    { text-decoration: none }
      }
    }

The resulting code is more concise, and mimics the structure of your `DOM tree`.

Notice the `&` combinator--it's used when you want a nested selector to be concatenated to its parent selector, instead
of acting as a descendant. This is especially important for pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus`.

For example:

    .bordered {
      &.float {
        float: left;
      }
      .top {
        margin: 5px;
      }
    }

Will output

    .bordered.float {
      float: left;
    }
    .bordered .top {
      margin: 5px;
    }

Operations
----------

Any number, color or variable can be operated on. Operations should be performed
within parentheses. Here are a couple of examples:

    @base: 5%;
    @filler: (@base * 2);
    @other: (@base + @filler);

    color: (#888 / 4);
    background-color: (@base-color + #111);
    height: (100% / 2 + @filler);

The output is pretty much what you expect—LESS understands the difference between colors and units. If a unit is used in an operation, like in:

    @var: (1px + 5);

LESS will use that unit for the final output—`6px` in this case.

Extra parentheses are also authorized in operations:

    width: ((@var + 5) * 2);

Color functions
---------------

LESS provides a variety of functions which transform colors. Colors are first converted to
the *HSL* color-space, and then manipulated at the channel level:

    lighten(@color, 10%);     // return a color which is 10% *lighter* than @color
    darken(@color, 10%);      // return a color which is 10% *darker* than @color

    saturate(@color, 10%);    // return a color 10% *more* saturated than @color
    desaturate(@color, 10%);  // return a color 10% *less* saturated than @color

    fadein(@color, 10%);      // return a color 10% *less* transparent than @color
    fadeout(@color, 10%);     // return a color 10% *more* transparent than @color
    fade(@color, 50%);        // return @color with 50% transparency

    spin(@color, 10);         // return a color with a 10 degree larger in hue than @color
    spin(@color, -10);        // return a color with a 10 degree smaller hue than @color

    mix(@color1, @color2);    // return a mix of @color1 and @color2

Using them is pretty straightforward:

    @base: #f04615;

    .class {
      color: saturate(@base, 5%);
      background-color: lighten(spin(@base, 8), 25%);
    }

You can also extract color information:

    hue(@color);        // returns the `hue` channel of @color
    saturation(@color); // returns the `saturation` channel of @color
    lightness(@color);  // returns the 'lightness' channel of @color
    alpha(@color);      // returns the 'alpha' channel of @color

This is useful if you want to create a new color based on another color's channel, for example:

    @new: hsl(hue(@old), 45%, 90%);

`@new` will have `@old`'s *hue*, and its own saturation and lightness.

Math functions
--------------

LESS provides a couple of handy math functions you can use on number values:

    round(1.67); // returns `2`
    ceil(2.4);   // returns `3`
    floor(2.6);  // returns `2`

If you need to turn a value into a percentage, you can do so with the `percentage` function:

    percentage(0.5); // returns `50%`

Namespaces
----------

Sometimes, you may want to group your variables or mixins, for organizational purposes, or just to offer some encapsulation.
You can do this pretty intuitively in LESS—say you want to bundle some mixins and variables under `#bundle`, for later re-use, or for distributing:

    #bundle {
      .button () {
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: grey;
        &:hover { background-color: white }
      }
      .tab { ... }
      .citation { ... }
    }

Now if we want to mixin the `.button` class in our `#header a`, we can do:

    #header a {
      color: orange;
      #bundle > .button;
    }

Scope
-----

Scope in LESS is very similar to that of programming languages. Variables and mixins are first looked up locally,
and if they aren't found, the compiler will look in the parent scope, and so on.

    @var: red;

    #page {
      @var: white;
      #header {
        color: @var; // white
      }
    }

    #footer {
      color: @var; // red
    }

Comments
--------

CSS-style comments are preserved by LESS:

    /* Hello, I'm a CSS-style comment */
    .class { color: black }

Single-line comments are also valid in LESS, but they are 'silent',
they don't show up in the compiled CSS output:

    // Hi, I'm a silent comment, I won't show up in your CSS
    .class { color: white }

Importing
---------

You can import `.less` files, and all the variables and mixins in them will be made available to the main file.
The `.less` extension is optional, so both of these are valid:

    @import "lib.less";
    @import "lib";

If you want to import a CSS file, and don't want LESS to process it, just use the `.css` extension:

    @import "lib.css";

The directive will just be left as is, and end up in the CSS output.

String interpolation
--------------------

Variables can be embeded inside strings in a similar way to ruby or PHP, with the `@{name}` construct:

    @base-url: "http://assets.fnord.com";
    background-image: url("@{base-url}/images/bg.png");

Escaping
--------

Sometimes you might need to output a CSS value which is either not valid CSS syntax,
or uses proprietary syntax which LESS doesn't recognize.

To output such value, we place it inside a string prefixed with `~`, for example:

    .class {
      filter: ~"ms:alwaysHasItsOwnSyntax.For.Stuff()";
    }

This is called an "escaped value", which will result in:

    .class {
      filter: ms:alwaysHasItsOwnSyntax.For.Stuff();
    }

JavaScript evaluation
---------------------

JavaScript expressions can be evaluated as values inside .less files. This is done by wrapping the expression
with back-ticks:

    @var: `"hello".toUpperCase() + '!'`;

Becomes:

    @var: "HELLO!";

Note that you may also use interpolation and escaping as with strings:

    @str: "hello";
    @var: ~`"@{str}".toUpperCase() + '!'`;

Becomes:

    @var: HELLO!;

It is also possible to access the JavaScript environment:

    @height: `document.body.clientHeight`;

If you want to parse a JavaScript string as a hex color, you may use the `color` function:

    @color: color(`window.colors.baseColor`);
    @darkcolor: darken(@color, 10%);
